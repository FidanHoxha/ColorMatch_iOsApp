# Color Match Game

This project is an iOs application created with XCode and Swift programming language.
The goal of this application is to be fun but challenging, while also training the thinking process of the players.
In the game, the player is presented two cards each containing a word. 
The word is a color, but also has a font color which might be different from its meaning. 
The player must compare the first card's meaning, to the second card's font color.
The tricky part is that the second card's meaning is often different from its color.
This trains the players "Response Inhibition" ability, which is the ability to suppress inappropriate responses that interefere with their actions.
This is because they must compare the font color of the second card, without paying to its meaning, which is often different.
The game has 3 different durations, which the player can select in the beginning of the game, and saves/displays the players score in a leadeboard.
